# Gitting Started

This repository is for storing what I learn about Git/GitHub. I hope others will find it useful as well. Jekyll automatically converts double dashes into single dashes. Triple dashes are converted into em dashes.

## Setting Up Git on a Mac
+ Download Git from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
+ Run commands from the command line using the built-in Terminal or iTerm2.
  + `git --version` (list current version on local computer)
  + `git config --global user.name "Kat Fries"`
  + `git config --global user.email katherynejf@gmail.com`
  + `git config â€“list` lists all Git settings
  + `git config user.name` will provide user's name
  + `man git` (full Git manual)


## Command Line Basics
### Moving around the Command Line
+	**(*tab button*)**: complete the name of the directory/file
+	**clear**: clears the bash screen

### High-Level User Commands aka *Porcelain Commands*
+	**pwd (Print Working Directory)**: returns current path directory e.g.: 
      `pwd`
  ==> `/Users/katsmac`
+	**ls (List)**: lists files and directories, e.g.:

Applications	Desktop
Downloads		README.md
+	**cd (Change Directory)**:
  +	**cd ..**					move up one directory
  +	**cd Desktop/**			takes a directory name as an argument
  +	**cd Downloads/git_tutorial**	moves to a directory within a directory
+	**touch**: creates a new empty file inside the working directory or updates the access date of the file without opening, saving and closing the file. 
+	**mkdir**: create a new empty folder



+	**add**: 
+	**commit**: 
+	**push**: 
+	**pull**: 
+	**branch**: 
+	**checkout**: 
+	**merge**: 

### Low-Level Commands aka *Plumbing Commands*
+	**cat-file**: 
+	**hash-object**:

NAME
       git - the stupid content tracker

SYNOPSIS
       git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p|--paginate|--no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           [--super-prefix=<path>]
           <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
       Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an
       unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and
       full access to internals.

       See gittutorial(7) to get started, then see giteveryday(7) for a useful
       minimum set of commands. The Git User's Manual[1] has a more in-depth
       introduction.

       After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this page
       to learn what commands Git offers. You can learn more about individual
Git commands with "git help command". gitcli(7) manual page gives you
       an overview of the command-line command syntax.

       A formatted and hyperlinked copy of the latest Git documentation can be
       viewed at https://git.github.io/htmldocs/git.html.

OPTIONS
       --version
           Prints the Git suite version that the git program came from.

       --help
           Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands.
           If the option --all or -a is given then all available commands are
           printed. If a Git command is named this option will bring up the
           manual page for that command.

           Other options are available to control how the manual page is
           displayed. See git-help(1) for more information, because git --help
           ...  is converted internally into git help ....
